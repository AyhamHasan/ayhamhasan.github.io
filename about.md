Hello, I'm Ayham Hasan, an Engineering major at George Mason University. This is my site to where I can discuss different topics and document projects or skills I take upon. I've been facinated by technology since I was young and decided I wanted to share my passion with the world. Here you'll find reviews, rants, discussions, and updates about my journey through the world of tech. 

### Some things I'm currently doing

- Learning different frameworks and librarys like Ruby (on rails), React, and some other front end stuff.
- Diving into low level code like C and hopefully C# in the summer. 
- I recenetly upgraded my drawing tablet so I've been drawing just a bit more than I used to.
