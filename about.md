Hello, I'm an CS student at George Mason University. This is my site to where I can discuss different topics and document projects or skills I take upon. I've been facinated by technology since I was young and decided I wanted to share my passion with the world. Here you'll find reviews, rants, discussions, and updates about my journey through the world of tech. 

### Some things I'm currently doing

- Finish my linux theme and configuration setup (if I could stop distro hopping...)
- Diving into C and UNIX and hopefully C# or some other languages in the summer. 
- I recenetly upgraded my drawing tablet so I've been drawing just a bit more than I used to.
