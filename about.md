Hello, I'm an CS student at George Mason University. This is my site to where I can discuss different topics and document projects I work on. I've been facinated by technology since I was young and decided I wanted to share my passion with the world. Here you'll find reviews, rants, discussions, and updates about my journey through the world of tech. 

### Some things I'm currently doing

- Completing my final year of university
- VR and embedded programming in the summer.
