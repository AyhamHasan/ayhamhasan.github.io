<p>Welcome to my blog. After grueling hours of trial and error, wiping my macbook, almost throwing my windows pc out the door, I managed to get this jekyll blog up and running.</p>

<p>As a newly realized web dev, this was frustrating. Getting localhost to work but now deployment to work <strong><em>ARGH</em></strong>…
Basically what I’m trying to say is: I miss doing for loops and arraylists in Java (speaking of…I have a java assignment due soon…).</p>
