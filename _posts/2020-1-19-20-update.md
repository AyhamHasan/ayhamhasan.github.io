# It's a new year.
### Plans and thoughts on this semester.
  To start off, I know I've been pretty absent from this site, which wasn't totally intentional but justified. First and foremost I worked hard to get myself onto the dean's list this past semester. That is quite the accomplishment coming from a very mediocre year prior. For this spring semester I'm quite excited because it's now my first full semester as a Computer Science major. The decision to switch from Computer Engineering to Computer Science was moreso due to the clarity of the majors that I got my freshman year. I found that while I do want to still do CpE things and work in the field if I can find the opportunities, being in CS will grant me more freedom in the technology field, and it alligns within my interests of Machine Learning and system programming that I've so far still been striving to research and work in, though I may grow out of this phase. The great thing is that all of my CpE courses that I was very much eager to take, is stil available for me to take as an elective course, so while my major has changed - the availability of the courses I want to take are still there and not just going to be extra credits to spend my GPA and money on.
  
### I'm also going to do some other stuff this semester
  I plan on taking more initiative in wasting less of my time doing nothing or nothing productive. I plan on diving deep into the C programming langugage. This will not only be for the class I'm taking on the language, but also because I want to learn more about UNIX operating systems, as someone who's been trying to configure their own linux system for a while now (to no success, but always one step towards my dream OS setup). I know it's probably outdated of me, but the perfect minimal linux environment will be very pleasing to use.
  
### 2020 technology
  2020 is the start of a new decade, and with it is the establishments of the concepts that were shown off in 2019. Foldable compute devices seem to be the consumer trend of this year, and while I'm too much of a mechnical keeb elitest to ever want to use a touchscreen computer, I do enjoy the fact that we could have bigger screen devices that become much much smaller for the sake of portability. Having a 17 inch device fold down to the size of a notebook would be excellent. While the tablet computer market seems to predict this will be the future of their devices (with Dell, Intel, and some other companies hopping on board with this concept), I think phones are where this will shine. Foldable phones are a dream of mine, seeing it in things like Westworld, Blade Runner, and other sci fi classics - the idea of having a small foldable become a large screened tablet (or phablet as it used to be called...) is great! Even better than big to bigger, small to big: a phone that is about the size of a typical smartphone that becomes half that size - like the Motorola Razr!

Here's to a new semester, a new job, and a new year in tech!
