# Hello!
### I finally got this to work.
Welcome to my blog. After grueling hours of trial and error, wiping my macbook, almost throwing my windows pc out the door, I managed to get this jekyll blog up and running. 

As a newly realized web dev, this was frustrating. Getting localhost to work but now deployment to work ***ARGH***...
Basically what I'm trying to say is: I miss doing for loops and arraylists in Java (speaking of...I have a java assignment due soon...).
